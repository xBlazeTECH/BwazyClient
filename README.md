# BwazyClient
BwazyClient is a web interface coded in Javascript, and framed using basic HTML that allows for clients to chat with players on the game "Minecraft" on the go, on smartphones and tablets. I personally believe in open source software, so BwazyClient will never have forced branding. The publicly hosted BwazyClient may have advertisements at first in order to support my development of the program, but the self-hosted instances don't have advertisements.

## History
I created this project with hopes that it could be used by a multitude of people to connect to minecraft servers from their smartphones, or tablets, without any of the annoying advertisements or "Promoted Servers" that some other clients have. The nice part about this, is it works regardless of the device you are on, and syncronizes between all your devices.
